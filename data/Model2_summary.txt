## Key Changes (high-level)

- Column section assignments have been changed from an auto-select list (`A-LatCol`) to a specific wide-flange section (`W12X65`) at many locations.
- A few column lines at specific stories remain assigned to `A-LatCol` instead of `W12X65`.
- Beams, slabs, materials, section property definitions, load patterns, and load cases are unchanged.

---

## Materials

- No material properties were added, removed, or modified.  
  The `MATERIAL` blocks for `A992Fy50`, `4000Psi`, `A615Gr60`, and `A416Gr270` are identical.

---

## Sections

- No frame, slab, deck, wall, tendon, or concrete section definitions were added, removed, or modified.  
  All `FRAMESECTION`, `SHELLPROP`, `CONCRETESECTION`, `TENDONSECTION`, and `AUTOSECTION` blocks are identical.

---

## Loads and Load Combinations

- Load patterns (`Dead`, `Live`) are unchanged.
- Load cases (`Modal`, `Dead`, `Live`) are unchanged.
- No load combinations are present in either file, so none were changed.

## Other Notable Changes

### Column Line Assignments (LINEASSIGN – SECTION)

In the OLD model, **all** column line assignments (`C1`–`C16` at all stories) used:
- `SECTION "A-LatCol"`

In the NEW model, many of these have been changed to:
- `SECTION "W12X65"`

Below is the precise change by line and story:

#### Story4 – Columns

- Changed from `A-LatCol` → `W12X65`:
  - `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, `C5`, `C6`, `C7`, `C9`, `C10`, `C11`, `C13`, `C14`, `C15`
- Remain `A-LatCol` (unchanged):
  - `C4`, `C8`, `C12`, `C16`

#### Story3 – Columns

- Changed from `A-LatCol` → `W12X65`:
  - `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, `C4`, `C5`, `C6`, `C7`, `C8`, `C9`, `C10`, `C11`, `C12`, `C13`, `C14`, `C15`, `C16`  
  (i.e., all columns at Story3 now use `W12X65`.)

#### Story2 – Columns

- Changed from `A-LatCol` → `W12X65`:
  - `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, `C4`, `C5`, `C6`, `C7`, `C8`, `C9`, `C10`, `C11`, `C12`, `C13`, `C14`, `C15`, `C16`  
  (i.e., all columns at Story2 now use `W12X65`.)

#### Story1 – Columns

- Changed from `A-LatCol` → `W12X65`:
  - `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, `C4`, `C6`, `C7`, `C8`, `C10`, `C11`, `C12`, `C13`, `C14`, `C15`, `C16`
- Remain `A-LatCol` (unchanged):
  - `C5`, `C9`

### Beam Line Assignments

- All beam line assignments (`B1`–`B24` with `SECTION "A-LatBm"` and `B25`–`B42` with `SECTION "A-CompBm"` and the same releases) are identical between OLD and NEW for all stories.

### Geometry, Stories, Grids, Diaphragms, Slabs, Walls, Links, Panel Zones

- Story definitions, grid systems, point coordinates, line/area connectivities, diaphragm definitions, slab/deck/wall/link/panel zone properties, and area assignments are unchanged.

### Design Preferences and Analysis Options

- Steel, concrete, composite beam, composite column, wall, and slab design preferences are unchanged.
- Analysis options, mass source, and function/response spectrum definitions are unchanged.
